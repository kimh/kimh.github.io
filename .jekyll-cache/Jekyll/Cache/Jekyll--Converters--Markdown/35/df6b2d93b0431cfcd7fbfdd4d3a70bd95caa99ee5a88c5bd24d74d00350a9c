I"K<p>Up until now, I thought average always exists. We are dealing with average very often in real life: the average height of Japanese, the average rate of divorcing in US, and the average salary in France, etc. It seemed to me that if I take enough number of sample data, I can get average that reflects the reality very well.</p>
