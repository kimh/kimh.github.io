It's already in Jan 2017 and I know it's too late to do retrospective for 2016 but doing late is better than not doing.
So here is a list of big ideas that I learned in 2016.

* How human perception is distorted and our cognitive ability is limited (from Thinking Fast and Slow)
* Chaos theory and the impossibility of future prediction
* Difference between simple and easy (from Rich Hickey's Simple Made Easy)
