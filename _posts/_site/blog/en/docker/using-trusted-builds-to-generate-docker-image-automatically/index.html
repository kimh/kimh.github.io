<h2 id="trusted-builds">Trusted Builds</h2>
<p>Recently, <a href="http://index.docker.io/" title="index.docker.io">index.docker.io</a> released a new feature called “Trusted Builds”.
Trusted Builds allows you to automatically builds a Docker container according to Dockerfile when you push to your Github repository.
In this post, I will share how to use it and one pitfall that I experienced.</p>

<h3 id="place-a-dockerfile-in-your-repo">Place a Dockerfile in your repo</h3>
<p>Trusted Builds knows how to make a new image by reading Dockerfile in your repository and uses repository as a context for the Dockerfile.
So, you first need to add a Dockerfile to your repository. Let’s put a very simple Dockerfile.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>from ubuntu
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This Dockerfile tells Trusted Builds to create a new image based on ubuntu image. Add the file and push to Github.</p>

<h3 id="link-github-and-register-repository">Link Github and register repository</h3>
<p>To use Trusted Builds, you need to link your Github account. Login to <a href="http://index.docker.io/" title="index.docker.io">index.docker.io</a> and go to [setting page](https://index.docker.io/builds/github/select/ “”).
Once you link Github accountm, you should see the list of your public repositories. Select the repository that you want to build and enter information used by Trusted Builds.</p>

<h5 id="default-branch">Default Branch</h5>
<p>Branch name that Trusted Builds uses</p>

<h5 id="repo-name">Repo Name</h5>
<p>This is used as a name of new image. Probably, Repo here means Docker’s repository, not Github repository. <strong>You should pick up the name carefully because you can’t change the name later.</strong></p>

<h5 id="docker-tag-name">Docker Tag Name</h5>
<p>The name of tag that you want put to a image</p>

<h5 id="dockerfile-location">Dockerfile Location</h5>
<p>Specify the location of Dockerfile in your repo. As I mentioned earlier, Trusted Builds uses your repo as a build context. Therefore, the top directory of your repo becomes the root of file path.
For example, if you put Dockerfile just under your repo’s top directory, you should specify <strong>/</strong> as Dockerfile location. Note that you only need to specify the directory name, not the path of Dockerfile.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code># Good
/
/build

# Bad
/Dockerfile
/build/Dockerfile
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Also note the file name should be Dockerfile. If you put other name, Trusted Builds can’t find the file.</p>

<p>You should be ready now! Press Submit button and a new build will start. Once builds finish, you will see a new image in the list of your repository.</p>

<h2 id="a-few-common-mistakes">A few common mistakes</h2>
<p>Did your build succeed? In my case, I made try &amp; error several times until it succeeds. Let me share them so you can save your time.</p>

<h5 id="is-the-file-name-of-dockerfile-correct">Is the file name of Dockerfile correct?</h5>
<p>The file name of your Dockerfile should be <em>Dockerfile</em>.</p>

<h5 id="did-you-specify-correct-path-to-your-dockerfile">Did you specify correct path to your Dockerfile?</h5>
<p>Dockerfile Location should be the path of directory where you have Dockerfile, not the whole path name of Dockerfile. Check the examples above.</p>

<h5 id="is-your-dockerfile-correct">Is your Dockerfile correct?</h5>
<p>Maybe you put wrong instruction in Dockerfile. You can test this by manually building a image by using docker command.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>docker build <span class="nt">-t</span> kimh/test_dockerfile github.com/kimh/baleen
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The above command assumes that you have Dockerfile at the top directory of your repo. If the command fails, make sure your instructions are correct.</p>

<h5 id="do-you-have-submodule-in-your-repository">Do you have submodule in your repository?</h5>
<p>This one took the most of debugging time for me. Currently, <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/docker-user/ZothnJ46Pps">Trusted Builds does not support git submodule</a>, so builds fails if you have a submodule in your repository.
For now, you have to remove the submodule to make build succeed.</p>
