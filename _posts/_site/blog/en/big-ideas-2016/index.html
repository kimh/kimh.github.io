<p>It’s already in Jan 2017 and I know it’s too late to do retrospective for 2016 but doing late is better than not doing.
So here is a list of big ideas that I learned in 2016.</p>

<ul>
  <li>How human perception is distorted and our cognitive ability is limited (from Thinking Fast and Slow)</li>
  <li>Chaos theory and the impossibility of future prediction</li>
  <li>Difference between simple and easy (from Rich Hickey’s Simple Made Easy)</li>
</ul>
